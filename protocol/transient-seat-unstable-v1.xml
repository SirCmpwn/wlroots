  <description summary="Protocol for creating temporary seats">
    The transient seat protocol can be used by clients to create independent
    seats that will be removed when the client disconnects. The client also gets
    a handle to the seat which can be used to remove the seat.

    <request name="create">
      <description summary="Create a transient seat">
        Create a new seat that is removed when the client closes the connection.

        The client may suggest a name for the seat, but the server may choose
        whichever name it sees fit, except the name must not collide with the
        name of another seat.

        It is suggested that the client choose a sufficiently unique name, e.g.
        something containing the pid and an incremental numeric value.
